- Dictionary -
A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.

- Dictionary in memory -
A hash table is a way of doing key-value lookups. 
You store the values in an array, and then use a hash function to find the
index of the array cell that corresponds to your key-value pair.

- Differences between Dictionary and List -
Dictionary
- Unordered: The items in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order.
- Access via keys: You access items in a dictionary using keys, not indices.
- Collection of key-value pairs: Each item in a dictionary is a key-value pair.
- Preferred when you have unique key values : Dictionaries are ideal when you need to associate unique keys with values.
- No duplicate members: Dictionaries do not allow duplicate keys, ensuring that each key is unique.

List
- Ordered: The items in a list are stored in a specific order.
- Access via indices: You access items in a list using indices, which are integers representing the position of the item in the list.
- Collection of elements: A list is a collection of elements, which can be of any data type.
- Preferred when order matters: Lists are ideal when the order of items is important, such as in a sequence or a collection of items that need to be processed in a specific order.
- Duplicate members allowed: Lists can contain duplicate elements, meaning the same value can appear multiple times in the list.
