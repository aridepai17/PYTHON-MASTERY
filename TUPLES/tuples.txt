- Tuples -
A tuple is an immutable sequence of Python objects.
Tuples are also comparable and hashable.

- Tuples VS Lists -
Tuples are immutable while Lists are mutable.
Tuples can be stored in Lists and Lists can be stored in Tuples.
Both Tuples and Lists can be nested
We generally use Tuples for heterogeneous data types and Lists for homogeneous data types.
Iteration through a tuple is faster than with Lists
Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as dictionary keys.
If you have data that does not change, implementing it as a Tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.
