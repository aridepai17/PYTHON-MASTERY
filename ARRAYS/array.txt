- Types of Arrays -

1. One Dimensional Array
An array with a bunch of values having been declared with a single index.
a[i] -> i between 0 and n

2. Two Dimensional Array
An array with a bunch of values having been declared with two indices.
a[i][j] -> i and j between 0 and n

3. Multi Dimensional Array
An array with a bunch of values having been declared with multiple indices.
a[i][j][k] -> i, j and k between 0 and n

- When to use arrays - 
1. To store multiple variables of same data type 
2. Random access 

- When not to use arrays -
1. Same data type elements 
2. Reserve memory
